## Introduction
This project is being developed as part of the "Fundamentals of Computing" discipline in pursuit of my MSc in Computer Science degree. It serves as a training project to apply and reinforce the concepts learned in the course. Please note that this project is a work in progress and may undergo changes and updates over time.


## Method: Data Processing
The main objective of this project is to process data from a CSV file containing job-related information. The data processing pipeline involves several steps:
- **Data Retrieval**: The project retrieves the job data from a CSV file using various methods including built-in file reading, pandas library, and csv library.
- **Data Treatment**: After retrieving the data, unnecessary columns are removed, and the remaining columns are renamed for clarity and consistency.
- **Data Analysis**: The processed data is then analyzed to extract insights such as average salary, average salary by country, and country-specific information.

### Reasoning
Processing the data allows for a better understanding of job trends, salary distributions, and other relevant information in the field of computing. By analyzing the data, we can identify patterns, trends, and correlations that may help in making informed decisions and recommendations.

## Results: Reflection & Evaluation
The initial results of the data processing and analysis include:
- The average salary in USD across all job listings.
- Average salary by country, providing insights into regional salary trends.
- Detailed information for specific countries, allowing for deeper analysis and exploration.

### Reflection
The process of working with real-world data has been educational and insightful. It has provided practical experience in data handling, analysis, and visualization.

## Conclusion (So Far)
In conclusion, this project represents a valuable learning experience in the field of data processing and analysis. It highlights the importance of applying theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and the iterative nature of the development process. Moving forward, the project will continue to evolve, incorporating feedback, addressing challenges, and striving for excellence.

## Work in Progress
Please note that this project is still a work in progress. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome and encouraged. Feel free to explore the code, provide insights, and collaborate to enhance the project further.
